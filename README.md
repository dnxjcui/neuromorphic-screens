# Neuromorphic Screens

A real-time event-based screen capture system that converts screen changes into neuromorphic events, inspired by Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). This system captures pixel-level changes as asynchronous, timestamped events and provides advanced visualization with downsampling and speed controls.

## Overview

Neuromorphic Screens implements a complete event-based screen capture pipeline:

1. **Real Screen Capture**: Uses Desktop Duplication API for high-performance screen capture  
2. **Event Generation**: Converts screen differences into DVS-style events with polarity
3. **Multi-Format Storage**: CSV, binary (.evt), and space-separated formats with rpg_dvs_ros compatibility
4. **Advanced Visualization**: Real-time event viewer with speed control and downsampling
5. **Interactive Replay**: Full event stream replay with statistics and user controls

## Event Processing Pipeline

1. **Screen Capture**: Desktop Duplication API captures frames at 60 FPS
2. **Frame Comparison**: Pixel-by-pixel luminance difference calculation
3. **Event Generation**: Changes above threshold generate polarity events
4. **Event Storage**: Events stored in binary format with timestamps
5. **Visualization**: Real-time replay with DVS-style dot visualization

## Configuration

### Change Threshold
The system uses a configurable pixel change threshold (default: 25/255 luminance units):
- Lower values: More sensitive, more events
- Higher values: Less sensitive, fewer events

### Event Filtering
Built-in filtering capabilities:
- Time range filtering
- Spatial region filtering
- Duplicate removal
- Event compression

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**: Ensure Windows SDK and DirectX are installed
2. **Capture Fails**: Check if Desktop Duplication is supported (Windows 8+)
3. **No Events**: Try moving the mouse or opening/closing windows during capture
4. **Viewer Not Responding**: Check if the event file is valid and contains events

### Performance Tips

- Use shorter capture durations for testing
- Adjust change threshold based on screen content
- Close unnecessary applications during capture
- Use SSD storage for better file I/O performance

## Future Enhancements

- **NVFBC Integration**: NVIDIA Frame Buffer Capture for GPU-accelerated capture
- **Multi-monitor Support**: Capture from multiple displays
- **Network Streaming**: Real-time event streaming over network
- **Advanced Filtering**: Spatial and temporal event filtering
- **Machine Learning**: Event-based pattern recognition
- **Cross-platform Support**: Linux and macOS compatibility

2. **Event Processing**: Advanced event filtering and analysis
3. **Visualization**: Enhanced viewer features and effects
4. **File Format**: Extended event metadata and compression
