# **Real-time Neuromorphic Event Stream Integration into BindsNET for Spiking Neural Network Applications**

### **1\. Introduction: Bridging Neuromorphic Vision and SNNs**

The landscape of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, with a growing emphasis on systems that can operate efficiently and respond in real-time to dynamic environments. A significant frontier in this evolution is the convergence of neuromorphic vision and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). This report provides a comprehensive guide for establishing a real-time data pipeline from neuromorphic screens, specifically event cameras, into SNNs simulated within the BindsNET framework. The objective is to detail the design and implementation of a low-latency streaming function and a robust framework for integrating this continuous event data, complete with explicit code examples in C++ and Python.

#### **Overview of Event-Based Vision and Neuromorphic Screens**

Neuromorphic screens, often synonymous with event cameras (also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors or DVS), represent a departure from conventional frame-based imaging. Instead of capturing static images at fixed intervals, these sensors record individual pixel-level changes in light intensity asynchronously.1 The output is a continuous stream of discrete "events," each signaling a brightness increase (ON) or decrease (OFF) at a specific pixel location and precise time. This event-driven paradigm offers several distinct advantages over traditional cameras, including the mitigation of motion blur, high dynamic range, and the ability to capture information at microsecond temporal resolutions, preserving critical data that might otherwise be lost.2 Each event typically comprises a timestamp (often in microseconds), x and y coordinates, and a polarity indicator.3 This sparse data representation is inherently efficient, as information is only transmitted when a change occurs, eliminating redundant data during periods of inactivity.

#### **The Role of Spiking Neural Networks in Event-Driven Systems**

Spiking Neural Networks are a class of neural networks that more closely mimic biological brains, processing information through discrete events called "spikes." This event-driven computational model makes SNNs naturally compatible with the asynchronous output of neuromorphic cameras.1 Unlike traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that process dense, synchronous frames, SNNs can natively handle the sparse, high-temporal-resolution spikes from event cameras, leading to inherently fast perception-action loops.

The synergy between event-based sensing and SNN computation presents a significant opportunity to develop highly efficient and responsive AI systems. Research has demonstrated that SNNs can achieve competitive performance and superior energy efficiency in vision-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks, sometimes even outperforming conventional ANNs in specific scenarios. For instance, SNN agents have shown human-level play in Atari games and exhibited enhanced reactivity and learning speed by directly processing continuous event streams, avoiding the latency and information loss associated with frame discretization. This architectural alignment between event-driven sensors and SNNs is not merely an optimization; it enables capabilities, such as ultra-low latency and high efficiency on sparse data, that frame-based systems struggle to achieve. This suggests a transformative approach for real-time AI applications, particularly in domains demanding rapid, continuous perception, and action, like robotics, autonomous systems, and high-speed control.

#### **Defining the Challenge: Streaming and Integration**

The core challenge addressed in this report involves two primary components: first, the efficient and low-latency streaming of high-rate, asynchronous event data from neuromorphic sensors; and second, the effective conversion and integration of this streamed data into SNN simulation frameworks, specifically BindsNET, for real-time processing, testing, and potential learning. This process necessitates careful consideration of appropriate data formats, robust communication protocols, and effective event-to-spike encoding strategies to maintain the temporal precision and efficiency inherent in event-based vision.

### **2\. Part 1: Designing and Implementing the Neuromorphic Event Streamer**

Implementing a real-time neuromorphic event streamer requires a deep understanding of the data's intrinsic characteristics and the selection of appropriate communication protocols and libraries to ensure low latency and high throughput.

#### **Understanding Neuromorphic Event Data Formats**

Neuromorphic event data, typically originating from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) like the DAVIS346 used in projects such as NeuroPong , is fundamentally sparse and asynchronous. Each event represents a localized change in pixel intensity, providing precise temporal and spatial information. The standard data structure for a single event is a tuple comprising:

* **Timestamp:** A uint64\_t value indicating the exact moment of the event, typically recorded in microseconds. This fine-grained temporal resolution is a defining feature and a key advantage of event cameras.3  
* **X-coordinate, Y-coordinate:** uint16\_t values specifying the pixel location on the sensor grid where the intensity change was detected.5  
* **Polarity:** A boolean or binary value (e.g., bool or uint8\_t) indicating whether the brightness at that pixel increased (ON event) or decreased (OFF event).4

These events are generated continuously and can reach rates of millions per second. This high data rate necessitates highly efficient methods for transmission and processing to preserve the low-latency benefits of neuromorphic sensing.

#### **Choosing Streaming Protocols and Libraries**

For establishing a low-latency, real-time data stream, binary protocols over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are generally preferred due to their efficiency compared to verbose text-based formats.8 UDP offers minimal overhead and lower latency, making it particularly suitable for high-rate, loss-tolerant event streams where speed is paramount. TCP, while providing guaranteed delivery and ordering, introduces higher overhead, which might be acceptable for scenarios where data integrity is critical and slight latency increases are tolerable.

Several libraries and frameworks facilitate event stream processing in both C++ and Python:

* **C++ Libraries:** The TENNLab framework-open 9, which forms the foundation of projects like NeuroPong, is predominantly a C++-based toolkit (93.1% C++) designed for embedded neuromorphic systems. Its focus on low-level control and performance makes it an excellent choice for implementing a high-throughput event streaming source or integrating directly with camera hardware SDKs. While general C++ streaming frameworks like  
  WindFlow or concord exist 11, the  
  event\_stream library (which has a C++ backend) is more specifically tailored for DVS data.6  
* **Python Libraries:** For consuming and, if necessary, generating event streams, dv-python 4 and  
  event\_stream 5 are highly effective Python libraries.  
  dv-python provides a direct interface to iniVation's Dynamic Vision System (DV) software, enabling live data capture from their cameras. event\_stream, with its C++-implemented core, offers UdpDecoder for receiving UDP event packets and Encoder for sending them, providing a robust and performant bridge between C++ and Python for event data. AEStream is another notable tool for efficient event data transmission with Python and C++ integration.12

The selection between event\_stream and dv-python for the Python consumer component is dependent on the specific hardware and software ecosystem generating the event data. event\_stream.UdpDecoder offers broader compatibility for generic C++ publishers or custom hardware interfaces, providing a versatile solution for various setups. Conversely, dv-python provides a native, streamlined integration for iniVation's DV camera systems. This highlights a critical decision point in the implementation pipeline that requires evaluating the user's existing hardware environment.

Effective real-time streaming necessitates a careful balance between the granularity of event transmission (individual events versus batches) and the overhead introduced by network protocols. Event cameras can generate millions of events per second. Sending each individual microsecond-timestamped event as its own UDP packet would result in an enormous number of packets, where the fixed overhead per packet (e.g., header size, processing) would quickly dominate the actual data payload. This would severely limit throughput and increase effective latency. Grouping multiple events into a single UDP packet (batching) is a crucial optimization for high-throughput event streams. This approach amortizes the per-packet overhead across many events, significantly reducing the total number of network operations and allowing the system to sustain higher event rates and achieve lower effective latency for the overall stream. This engineering principle is vital for bridging the high temporal resolution of event cameras with the practicalities of network communication and downstream processing.

| AEStream | Python (C/C++ backend) | Efficient event data transmission, diverse I/O | Various (internal) | NumPy array (t, x, y, p) | Stream processing, cross-language integration | High |

#### **C++ Implementation: Event Data Publisher (Simulated/Hardware Interface)**

This C++ component serves as the source of the neuromorphic event stream. It can either simulate event data for development and testing or interface directly with a physical neuromorphic camera's SDK (e.g., for a DAVIS346, as used in NeuroPong ) to capture raw events. The captured or simulated events are then packaged into a compact binary format and streamed over a chosen network protocol, such as UDP, to a consumer application.

A C++ application can leverage standard socket programming interfaces (\<sys/socket.h\>, \<netinet/in.h\>, \<arpa/inet.h\>) to create a UDP sender. To ensure efficient transmission of structured event data, a C++ struct can precisely define the event format, matching the expected byte layout (e.g., event\_stream's dvs\_dtype). For actual neuromorphic cameras (e.g., iniVation's DAVIS series), this C++ publisher would integrate with the manufacturer's SDK (e.g., iniVation's DV SDK, which dv-python wraps 4). The SDK would provide the raw event stream, which this C++ application would then package and stream.

C++ provides fine-grained control for achieving extremely low latency. Batching events (sending multiple events in one UDP packet) is crucial to minimize network overhead and maximize throughput, as demonstrated in the example. The \#pragma pack(push, 1\) directive ensures the DVSEvent struct is tightly packed, preventing compiler-added padding that could mismatch network byte streams. Direct casting of the DVSEvent struct to bytes for sendto assumes consistent byte order (endianness) between sender and receiver. Little-endian is common for x86/ARM architectures, matching event\_stream's dvs\_dtype (\<u8, \<u2). The example also explicitly prepends a uint64\_t timestamp to each UDP packet to ensure compatibility with event\_stream.UdpDecoder.5

#### **Python Implementation: Event Data Consumer**

This Python script is designed to receive the UDP stream originating from the C++ publisher (or a real camera via dv-python) and transform the raw event data into a format suitable for BindsNET.

The event\_stream.UdpDecoder is an excellent choice for this task, as it is specifically designed for event-stream encoded UDP packets and benefits from a C++-backed implementation for performance.5 Alternatively, if the event source is an iniVation DV system,

dv.NetworkEventInput provides a native and convenient interface.4 The choice between these two depends on the specific hardware setup, with

event\_stream offering more general compatibility for custom C++ publishers, and dv-python providing a direct, optimized interface for iniVation cameras.

### **3\. Part 2: Integrating Streamed Events into BindsNET**

Integrating the live neuromorphic event stream into a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) simulation requires careful handling of data formats and temporal alignment. BindsNET, built on PyTorch, provides the necessary tools for this integration.

#### **BindsNET Fundamentals for Event Input**

BindsNET is a robust Python package designed for the simulation of SNNs, particularly for machine learning and reinforcement learning applications.13 Its core architecture comprises

bindsnet.network.nodes (representing neuron populations) and bindsnet.network.topology (defining connections), all orchestrated by a central bindsnet.network.Network object.13

A fundamental aspect of BindsNET is its reliance on torch.Tensor objects for all data representations, including network inputs, neuronal states, and synaptic weights.13 This means that raw neuromorphic event data, typically received as NumPy arrays (from

event\_stream) or custom objects (from dv-python), must be converted into a torch.Tensor format before being fed into the SNN. The bindsnet.network.nodes.Input layer is specifically provided to accept user-defined input spikes.16 When running a simulation, input data is typically passed to the network's

run method as a dictionary where keys are layer names and values are torch.Tensors representing spike trains over time.

The Network object is initialized with a dt (simulation timestep in milliseconds), which defines the discrete temporal granularity of the simulation.13 This implies that asynchronous event data, with its microsecond precision, must be aggregated or binned to fit these fixed timesteps. For instance, NeuroPong downsampled its DVS events to a 16x10 grid to reduce complexity, demonstrating a practical approach to spatial and temporal binning.

#### **Event-to-Spike Encoding Strategies**

Raw neuromorphic events (tuples of timestamp, x, y, polarity) are not directly interpretable as spike trains by SNNs. Therefore, an encoding step is essential to transform this raw data into a format suitable for the SNN. The bindsnet.encoding module offers utilities for this purpose.15

Common encoding methods relevant to event data include:

* **Poisson Encoding:** This method converts an input intensity (e.g., event count per pixel over a time bin) into a probabilistic spike rate, where higher intensity corresponds to a higher likelihood of spiking.15 For event data, this typically involves spatially binning events into a grid and temporally accumulating them over a fixed  
  dt window, then applying Poisson sampling.  
* **Rate Encoding:** Similar to Poisson encoding, a continuous input value (e.g., aggregated event count) is mapped to a constant spike rate over a defined time window. It is a simpler, deterministic version of rate-based coding.  
* **Delta Modulation / Temporal Encoding:** This approach directly leverages the asynchronous nature of events. A spike is generated in the SNN only when a significant change (an event) occurs at a specific location. The polarity of the event can be used to influence the neuron's membrane potential or to activate separate ON/OFF pathways. This method aims to preserve the temporal precision of the event camera output more directly.  
* **Accumulation/Binning:** This is a practical and widely used preprocessing step for event data. Events arriving within a short time window (matching the SNN's dt) are accumulated into a fixed-size spatial grid (e.g., 16x10, as used in NeuroPong ). Each cell in this grid can then represent the number of events, or simply a binary spike if any event occurred, within that dt window. This binned representation can then be fed into a rate-based or Poisson encoder.

The choice of encoding strategy significantly impacts how the temporal information from event cameras is utilized by the SNN. While some methods like accumulation and Poisson encoding discretize the continuous event stream into fixed time bins, potentially losing some microsecond-scale temporal precision, they simplify the input for SNNs operating on a fixed dt. Other methods, like delta modulation, attempt to preserve more of the asynchronous nature. The optimal strategy often depends on the specific task and the SNN architecture's sensitivity to precise spike timing versus overall event density.

#### **BindsNET Integration Framework**

The integration framework involves a continuous loop that:

1. Receives event data chunks from the consumer queue.  
2. Preprocesses and encodes these events into torch.Tensor spike trains.  
3. Feeds the spike trains into the BindsNET SNN.  
4. Runs the SNN simulation for a specified duration.  
5. Extracts outputs for decision-making or learning.

The BindsNET Network object accepts torch.Tensor objects as input. For a DVS, the input layer size should correspond to the binned spatial resolution (e.g., width \* height). If polarity is treated separately (e.g., ON and OFF channels), the input layer size would be 2 \* width \* height.

### **4\. Conclusions and Recommendations**

The integration of real-time neuromorphic event streams into Spiking Neural Networks via frameworks like BindsNET represents a powerful paradigm for developing highly efficient and responsive AI systems. The fundamental compatibility between the asynchronous, event-driven nature of neuromorphic cameras and SNNs unlocks capabilities for ultra-low latency perception-action loops and significant energy efficiency, particularly in applications where rapid, continuous processing of dynamic visual information is critical. This approach offers a compelling alternative to traditional frame-based vision systems, which often struggle with the temporal precision and efficiency required for time-sensitive tasks.

The implementation guidance provided demonstrates that a robust pipeline can be established using a combination of C++ for low-latency event publishing and Python for consumption and SNN integration. The choice of streaming libraries, such as event\_stream for general UDP communication or dv-python for specific camera ecosystems, is a crucial decision point that depends on the user's existing hardware setup. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the streaming process is significantly enhanced by batching events at the C++ publisher level, which minimizes network overhead and maximizes throughput, enabling the system to handle the high data rates characteristic of event cameras.

For integrating data into BindsNET, the conversion of raw events into torch.Tensor spike trains through appropriate encoding strategies (e.g., accumulation and Poisson encoding) is essential. This step bridges the asynchronous event data with the discrete timestep (dt) of the SNN simulation. While this binning might discretize the microsecond precision of events, it is a practical necessity for current SNN simulation frameworks and has been successfully applied in projects like NeuroPong, which demonstrated real-time control of an Atari game from live event camera input.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Hardware-Software Alignment:** Prioritize the selection of event streaming libraries and protocols based on the specific neuromorphic camera hardware in use. For iniVation cameras, dv-python offers a native and streamlined approach. For other hardware or custom C++ event sources, event\_stream provides a versatile and performant UDP-based solution.  
2. **Optimize for Throughput:** Implement event batching in the C++ streaming function to aggregate multiple events into single network packets. This practice is vital for reducing network overhead and maintaining high throughput, which is critical for processing the high event rates from neuromorphic sensors.  
3. **Strategic Event Encoding:** Carefully consider and experiment with different event-to-spike encoding strategies within BindsNET. While simple accumulation and Poisson encoding provide a robust starting point, exploring temporal encoding methods or adaptive binning could further leverage the fine-grained temporal information from event cameras for specific tasks.  
4. **Asynchronous Processing:** Employ multi-threading or asynchronous programming techniques to separate the event consumption process from the SNN simulation loop. This ensures that the SNN can process data continuously without being blocked by network I/O, maintaining the low-latency benefits of the event-driven pipeline.  
5. **Performance Tuning:** Continuously monitor and profile the performance of both the C++ streamer and the Python consumer/SNN integration. Fine-tuning parameters such as batch size, network buffer sizes, and BindsNET's dt can significantly impact overall system latency and efficiency.  
6. **Scalability Considerations:** For larger-scale SNNs or more complex tasks, investigate BindsNET's capabilities for GPU acceleration and consider distributed processing if the computational demands exceed a single machine's capacity.
